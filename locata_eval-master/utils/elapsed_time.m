function timestamps = elapsed_time( time )

% timestamps = elapsed_time( time )
% evaluate time delays between time stamps
%
% Inputs:
%   time:           6 x T matrix of date vectors, where each 6 x 1 vector
%                   is formatted as [Year Month Day Hour Minute Second]
%
% Outputs:
%   timestamps:     1 x T vector of time delays, evaluated using etime
